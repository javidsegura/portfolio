                                                Beyond the code and equations, I'm someone who thrives on challenges and continuous growth. Whether I'm training for a triathlon, strategizing on the basketball court, or calculating probabilities at the poker table, I approach every endeavor with the same analytical mindset and competitive drive that fuels my technical work.
